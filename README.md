# GoodwinR-1SayHello

Review by Dan Decoito: The app is good and works as intended. I like that you added a  TryParse to validate for alphabet characters. Althogh, it will still work with a mix of characters and numbers. also maybe set up a situation where the user dosent input anything. I also like the use of != to terimante the game replay loop.
